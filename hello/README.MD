I implemented this project by carefully following the instructions provided in the assignment folder.
I thought it was very interesting that we had to install the kernel everytime before running. I am still not confident in my knowledge of kernels and how they work in theory so I will be researching a little bit before the next project
I am looking forward to the next project and being able to write in C and use github more as this was my first time.
